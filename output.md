**Notes:**

*   The costs included within "Bathroom Renovation" and "Outdoor Living Area" have been allocated to specific deliverables within those milestones.
*   "Inline Extraction Fan" is listed as a separate milestone because it affects the laundry and bathroom.
* Builders Warranty Insurance is not included as the cost is TBC
